        <p class="about-me-text text-font"> Hello! My name is <strong> William Riddle</strong> and this is my portfolio website. I am a pretty reserved guy and I always wish I could work harder, but I never do. Nonetheless, I have made this little website to showcase what I have done. I hope you enjoy my pieces of writing and other querky content. </p>

        <p class="text-font PIU-TEXT">I work at a kids birthday party facility called Pump it Up. I have been employed here for 9 months, and I am currently still employed. The parties consist of children jumping on inflatables then eating cake and pizza after, at a quick glance.</p>

        My free-time activity is reading. Reading is a huge inspiration for all my work, and it always keeps my brain stimulated. I primarily read fantasy. My Goodreads account can be found below.

            <p class="text-font Project-text">Liquid or Life is a bit of a longer tale. Although I will label this a "short-story", it is quite  a hefty read. This story features a young boy, Joseph, who goes through a whirlpool of experiences. He believes he is an adult trapped in the body of a boy. All he seeks is for the answers to his questions. </p>

            </a>
            <p class="text-font Project-text">Duality is a short story about a teenager caught between feeling isolated and being the most popular. He must keep up images as to not lose his projected image, while simultaneously dealing with his internal image of himself. This is my second short story so far.</p>

            </a>
            <p class="text-font Project-text">Poetry is essential to anyone's enrichment. Writing poetry can expel feelings of despair, lonliness, and general depression. Poetry, thus, is an integral part of expressing one's self. Here is some of my own poetry, though it is quite depressing. I create poems almost daily, but not all of them make it onto this doc. These are all of my favorites. </p>
